# Cake

**Cake (C# Make)** is a cross-platform build automation system that leverages a powerful and expressive C# DSL (Domain-Specific Language). It allows developers to automate common tasks like:

- Compiling source code
- Copying files and folders
- Running unit tests
- Packaging and publishing NuGet packages
- Zipping files
- And much more

Whether you're working on .NET or other platforms, Cake enables you to write build scripts in C# and run them locally or on CI/CD pipelines with ease.
