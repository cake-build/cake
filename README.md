## Documentation

You can read the latest documentation at [http://cakebuild.net/](http://cakebuild.net/).

## Example

This example dowloads the Cake bootstrapper and executes a simple build script.
The bootstrapper is used to bootstrap Cake in a simple way and is not in
required in any way to execute build scripts. If you prefer to invoke the Cake
executable yourself, [take a look at the command line usage](http://cakebuild.net/docs/cli/usage).

This example is also available on our homepage:
[http://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/setting-up-a-new-project](http://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/setting-up-a-new-project)

### 1. Install the Cake bootstrapper

The bootstrapper is used to download Cake and the tools required by the
build script.

##### Windows

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest http://cakebuild.net/bootstrapper/windows -OutFile build.ps1
```

##### Linux

```console
curl -Lsfo build.sh http://cakebuild.net/bootstrapper/linux
```

##### OS X

```console
curl -Lsfo build.sh http://cakebuild.net/bootstrapper/osx
```

### 2. Create a Cake script

Add a cake script called `build.cake` to the same location as the
bootstrapper script that you downloaded.

```csharp
var target = Argument("target", "Default");

Task("Default")
  .Does(() =>
{
  Information("Hello World!");
});

RunTarget(target);
```

### 3. Run it!

##### Windows

```powershell
# Execute the bootstrapper script.
./build.ps1
```

##### Linux / OS X

```console
# Adjust the permissions for the bootstrapper script.
chmod +x build.sh

# Execute the bootstrapper script.
./build.sh
```
